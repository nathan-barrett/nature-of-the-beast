# Hey

This is a little side project I'm working on with a friend. Maybe it will go somewhere, maybe it won't. It was bootstrapped with create-react-app version 2.1.1, with the typescript flag.

This shouldn't matter as much, but I'm using the most recent node LTS, 10.14 (deuterium).

## To run:

It shouldn't be too hard.

-   `$ npm install`
-   `$ npm start`

## To deploy to github pages

-   `$ npm run deploy`
